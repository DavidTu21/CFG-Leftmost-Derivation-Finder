# CFG-Leftmost-Derivation-Finder
A project to find leftmost derivations in context free languages.

## Description
Given a context-free grammar G, this program generates a leftmost derivation for a given string w by a recursive search if one exists within k steps. If such a k-step derivation does not exist, it returns false.

## How to run
$ python a.py test2

Enter String: abbbaa

Enter k: 2
